# Excel Sales Data Analysis & Visualization: Coffee Sales

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive sales analysis for a coffee business, delivering actionable insights to drive revenue growth and optimize marketing spend. By creating an interactive dashboard, stakeholders can now instantly identify top-performing products, pinpoint key geographic markets, and understand the purchasing behavior of their most valuable customers.

## üìä Dashboard Features

The Excel dashboard includes the following interactive elements:

*   **Sales Trend Analysis:** The interactive timeline allows for tracking revenue performance over time to identify seasonal trends and measure the impact of sales initiatives.
*   **Product Performance Analysis:** By filtering by **Roast Type** and **Size**, we can determine which products are the most popular and which have untapped potential. For example, the dashboard reveals that Medium Roast is the highest-selling roast type overall.
*   **Geographic Sales Insights:** The **Sales by Country** chart pinpoints our most lucrative markets, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and resource allocation.
*   **Customer Segmentation:** The **Loyalty Card** slicer helps us understand the value of our loyalty program by comparing the spending habits of members vs. non-members. This answers the critical question: "Do our loyalty members spend more?"
*   **High-Value Customer Identification:** The **Top 5 Customers** chart identifies our VIPs, providing a clear focus for customer retention and relationship management efforts.
