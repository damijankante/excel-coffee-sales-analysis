## üìà Project Overview

This project showcases a complete business intelligence workflow, transforming over **10,000 rows of raw, intentionally corrupted sales data** into a fully interactive and insightful dashboard. The goal was to analyze a coffee sales dataset to uncover actionable insights that could drive revenue, enhance profitability, and inform marketing strategy.

The analysis moves beyond simple reporting, demonstrating a robust ETL pipeline, advanced data modeling, and complex analytics, all within Microsoft Excel. The final result is an executive-ready dashboard designed for dynamic exploration and data-driven decision-making.

## ‚ùì Key Business Questions Answered

The dashboard was built to answer critical business questions at a glance:

1.  **Sales Performance:** What are our key revenue and profit trends over time, and can we identify seasonality?
2.  **Product Profitability:** Which products are our bestsellers, and more importantly, which ones are the most *profitable*? Where are our hidden gems with high profit margins?
3.  **Geographic Hotspots:** Which countries are driving the most sales, and where are the emerging markets?
4.  **Customer Value & Loyalty:** What is the real lifetime value (CLV) of our customers? Are members of our loyalty program genuinely more valuable than non-members?
5.  **The 80/20 Rule:** Which vital few customers are generating the majority of our revenue?

## üõ†Ô∏è The BI Workflow & Technical Stack

This project was built using a modern Excel BI toolkit, demonstrating skills across the entire analytics pipeline.

### 1. ETL & Data Cleaning (Power Query)

The initial data, expanded to 10,000+ orders, was intentionally corrupted with realistic errors to simulate a real-world scenario. 
A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline was built in **Power Query** to handle these issues automatically:

*   **Data Integration:** Merged three separate tables (`Orders`, `Customers`, `Products`) into a clean, unified dataset
*   **Duplicate Removal:** Identified and removed fully duplicated order entries.
*   **Data Validation:** Filtered out invalid records, such as orders with a quantity of zero or negative numbers.
*   **Text Cleansing & Standardization:** Used `Trim`, `Capitalize Each Word`, and `Replace Values` to standardize inconsistent `Country` names (e.g., "  usa ", "USA", "united states" all became "United States").
*   **Handling Missing Data:** Identified and removed records with critical missing information (e.g., null values in the `Country` field).
*   **Orphaned Record Removal:** Performed an `Inner Join` to ensure every order record corresponds to a valid customer, removing any orphaned data.

### 2. Data Modeling & Advanced Analytics (Power Pivot & DAX)

The cleaned data was loaded into Excel's **Power Pivot** engine to create a relational Data Model (a star schema). This enabled sophisticated calculations using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**:

*   **Calculated Columns** to enrich the data tables:
    *   `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`: Calculates the total revenue generated by each customer.
    *   `Purchase Frequency`: Counts the number of unique orders placed by each customer.
*   **DAX Measures** for dynamic, aggregated analysis:
    *   `Total Sales Amount` & `Total Profit Amount`
    *   `Profit Margin %`
    *   `Count of Orders`
    *   `Average Order Value`

### 3. Data Visualization & Reporting (Excel Dashboard)

The final insights are presented in a fully interactive dashboard featuring:

*   **KPI Cards:** Clear, at-a-glance metrics for Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, and Average Order Value.
*   **Advanced Charting:**
    *   **Map Chart:** For intuitive visualization of sales distribution by country.
    *   **Pareto Chart:** To instantly identify the top 20% of customers who generate 80% of the revenue.
    *   **Dynamic Combo & Bar Charts:** To explore trends and comparisons.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Slicers and Timelines allow for seamless filtering of the entire dashboard by Roast Type, Size, Loyalty Status, and Date.

### 4. Synthetic Data Generation (Python)

To create a more challenging and realistic dataset, the original 1,000 orders were expanded to over 10,000 using a **Python** script with the **Pandas** and **Faker** libraries. This process also introduced the specific data quality issues mentioned above, providing a foundation to demonstrate advanced data cleaning skills.


## üîë Strategic Recommendations & Findings

The comprehensive dashboard confirms and reinforces several critical business trends that demand strategic attention.

*   **Recommendation 1: Address Sustained Sales Decline.**
    *   *Finding:* After peaking at **$68,746** in 2021, the business has seen a consistent year-over-year decline in revenue, falling to **$52,225** in 2024 (a **24% drop** from the peak). The 2025 data, representing only the first seven months, currently stands at **$33,076**, indicating that the downward trend is continuing.
    *   *Business Implication:* This is no longer an emerging trend but a sustained pattern. An urgent strategic review is needed to diagnose the root causes. Those could include market saturation, competitive pressure, or ineffective marketing. The business must implement new strategies to reverse this multi-year decline.

*   **Recommendation 2: Implement a Dual-Strategy for Geographic Markets.**
    *   *Finding:* The business is heavily reliant on a few key markets. The **United States** single-handedly accounts for **$271,849** of the **$394,779** total sales (approximately **69%**). A clear tiering system is visible: Ireland is a strong second-tier market at **$53,302**, while the United Kingdom is a distant third at **$26,411**.
    *   *Business Implication:* This data dictates a dual strategy. A **defensive, high-investment strategy** is required to protect and grow the dominant U.S. market. Simultaneously, a targeted **growth strategy** should be developed to expand market share in Ireland and the U.K., which have proven potential but are significantly smaller than the U.S.

*   **Recommendation 3: Prioritize High-Value Customer Retention.**
    *   *Finding:* The Pareto analysis confirms that a minority of customers drives the majority of revenue. Specifically, the top 5 customers (led by Donny Fries at **$956.93**) contribute over **$4,460** in sales combined. This highlights their immense value, especially when compared to the company-wide Average Order Value of only **$40.01**.
    *   *Business Implication:* This finding validates the critical need for a VIP customer relationship management (CRM) program. Implementing personalized marketing, exclusive offers, and dedicated support for this top customer segment is crucial for long-term revenue stability and maximizing customer lifetime value.

### üöÄ Future Enhancements & Learning Roadmap

*   **Time Intelligence Analysis:** Implement more advanced DAX time intelligence functions like `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, `YTD`, and `MTD` to compare performance against historical periods.
*   **Market Basket Analysis:** Analyze which products are most frequently purchased together to inform cross-selling strategies and product bundling.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Utilize Excel's forecasting tools or Python's `statsmodels` library to build a simple sales forecast based on historical data.
*   **Migration to Power BI:** For enhanced scalability, collaboration, and cloud-based features, the next logical step would be to migrate this entire data model and report into **Microsoft Power BI**.
